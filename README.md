Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in mathematical reasoning using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques. However, unlike human problem-solving—which often leverages analogous past examples—current methods directly generate answers. Inspired by this, we introduce MetaLadder, a framework that prompts LLMs to recall similar meta-problems and their CoT solutions before tackling the target problem. Experiments on mathematical benchmarks show that MetaLadder boosts accuracy by 10.3% over standard CoT approaches.

## 🔄 Self-evolution
1. Data Sampling
   - For standard data sampling, run:

     ```
     bash sample.sh
     ```
   - For sampling on reversed data, run:

     ```
     bash reverse_sample.sh
     ```
2. Data Augmentation

   Append the sampled data to the original dataset.
3. Retrain the Base Model

   ```
   bash train.sh
   ```
